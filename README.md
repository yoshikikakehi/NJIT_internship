# NJIT_internship

Scripts and code used for nanomaterial research at NJIT internship.

1) Bash Script analyzes high-performance computing on NJIT supercomputer Kong by plotting runtime Vs. number of core optimization on given projects based on data file inputted.
2) MATLAB Script analyzes the effects of geometric irregularities in 2-dimensional MoS2 on the frictional force and torque recorded at the indentation model which was implemented via a classical Molecular Dynamic approach. Graphs the correlation between time vs frictional force and time vs frictional torque at the indentation for the given data sets inputted.
